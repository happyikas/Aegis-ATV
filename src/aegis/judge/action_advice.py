"""ActionAdvice — sLLM output schema (PR-ζ-schema, Phase A finale).

The Aegis CCTV → sLLM → next-action pipeline (per the patent design
intent) needs a structured contract for what the sLLM returns.
This module defines that contract:

* :class:`ActionAdvice` — the dataclass an advisor produces.
* :func:`compose_advice_heuristic` — a deterministic composer that
  builds an ActionAdvice from a TemporalContext (PR-θ) + anomaly
  tags (PR-ε). It's a *heuristic* placeholder — PR-ζ-head will
  swap the body for an actual sLLM call. The SCHEMA stays the
  same; only the brain changes.
* :func:`render_advice` — operator-readable rendering.
* JSON I/O helpers for persisting advices into the audit chain.

What this is NOT (yet)
----------------------
* Not the sLLM call — that's PR-ζ-head.
* Not a verdict replacement — current step340 keeps producing
  :class:`aegis.schema.Verdict`. ActionAdvice is the *next-action
  recommendation* surface, intended to coexist with verdicts.
* Not wired into the firewall — the heuristic here is for
  testing the schema and providing a fallback when the sLLM is
  unavailable.

Why dataclass first, sLLM later
-------------------------------
Locking the I/O contract before the model call means:
* Tests can verify the schema invariants today
* Multiple advisors (heuristic / Phi-3 / Haiku / future learned
  head) all produce the same shape
* Audit-chain serialization spec is stable across model swaps
* Cross-checking ATV-attribution-head + sLLM verdict (the
  hallucination control) needs both to speak the same shape

The patent claim "sLLM understands the scene and recommends the
next action" requires the recommendation to BE structured —
arbitrary free text wouldn't let downstream firewall enforcement
act on it.

    Fields
    ------
    verb:
        One of :data:`ActionVerb` — closed catalog so the operator UI,
        downstream automation, and audit replay can depend on the set.
    parameters:
        verb-specific dict of concrete values (turn indices, model
        names, file paths, tokens-saved estimates, etc.). Required
        keys are enforced by ``_VERB_PARAM_KEYS``; extra keys allowed.
    expected_impact:
        Quantitative outcome string (e.g. "saves ~$0.42; reduces
        ratio 1.50 → 1.18"). Bounded to 256 chars in JSON I/O.
    confidence:
        Self-reported in [0, 1]. The operator UI may show different
        affordances for low-confidence steps.
    cited_signals:
        Names of the COST / CACHE / SECURITY / TEMPORAL signals that
        directly support this step. Audit traceability + dashboard
        drill-through.

    Why a closed verb catalog
    -------------------------
    sLLM hallucinations like "do-magic-fix" would otherwise pollute
    the audit chain. The defensive parser drops any step whose verb
    isn't in the catalog. This makes Tier 3 advisors usable with raw
    Haiku 4.5 (no fine-tuning) — the schema constrains the freedom.

    next_action_hint:
        Free-text suggestion of what the agent should do next.
        Examples: "Ask the user to confirm intent before retrying."

        ``None`` when there's no specific hint beyond the verdict.
    alternative_tool:
        Suggested tool name to try instead of the one being gated.
        ``None`` when no alternative is identifiable.
    cited_anomalies:
        Names of :class:`AnomalyTag.metric` that drove this advice.
        Audit traceability.
    cited_turns_rel:
        ``turn_index_rel`` values from the TemporalContext that the
        advisor explicitly considered. Audit traceability.
    advisor_kind:
        Which advisor produced this. ``"heuristic"`` for the
        composer in this module; sLLM advisors set their own.
    advisor_hash:
        SHA3-256 of the advisor implementation version. Pin to a
